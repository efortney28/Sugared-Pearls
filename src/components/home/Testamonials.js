          Thank you so much Ms Tammy for the delicious pies on Thanksgiving!!
          The coconut meringue was my absolute favorite and I had to hide a
          piece away for later. The sweet potato and pecan pie was a big hit
          with the family!!! They were absolutely delicious!! Thank you for the
          hard work on all the homemade goodness and I cannot wait for another
          holiday to have more coconut meringue, so I‚Äôll have to make up my own
          holiday to have another one soon‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I would absolutely recommend 100
          percent!!! Thank you Ms Tammy!!!

          I made my first order from Tammy. It was done on time no hidden
          costs,and most of all they were the best cake pops I could of ever
          asked for. Already made a second order for a birthday cake for next
          month. üëçüëçüëç
